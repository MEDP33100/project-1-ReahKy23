# MEDP 33100 Project 1: Interactive Storytelling

## Project Overview

With this project I want to create a visual telling of the classic nursery Rhyme: The Itsy Bitsy Spider. The project is a more noir take on the store. Using grayscale images (for the most part, the sun may be the only color added to the project). The images are static-y. Almost a horror retelling of the rhyme.

## Figma Design

- Provide a link to the Figma design of the webpage: https://www.figma.com/design/wfn1JNfhnIBrj9LI5OcUSg/medp331-project1?node-id=13-78&t=uelMiwtIJ9VDqH6g-1
- I knew I wanted to go for a "film noir" color scheme. Taking a dark approach to a nursery rhyme. (A lot of people talk about how sad most nurseru rhymes lyrics are).
- I found most of my images for the project on pinterest. I just got rid of the backgrounds in Photoshop so that they could overlap with each other without empty space. I wanted to emulate stop-motion movies, like Coraline with my Gsap/ JS animations. I found the sound effects on free sounds.org and youtube. None of which are copyright infringing. Most of my animations will be from the Gsap library. Sound effects are used to indicate when something happened in the scene (a crash of thunder for a sudden storm, sound of the spider).



## Features

- List the key features of the project, including: 
- The user would press the next page button to move to the next timeline / line of the story. When they hover over the button it could fill in so that they know to click it. I could also use a gsap timeline to make it blink, to get the user’s attention. 
 


    - **Animations**: I used gsap, and js animations. I used mainly gsap for the spider's movement, and js for the text overlay. 
    - **Sound Effects**: There are sound effects used, and they are used to indicate a change in environment. I wanted to emerse the user into the space of the story. So i wanted to emulate what the surroundings would be like (a sudden storm, the sound of the spider, etc.) 
    - **User-triggered Events**: Most of my events in my project are connected to event listeners, so when they user clicks on the page or a button, it triggers gsap timelines and other js code. I've mainly used hovering and clicking evenlisteners. Depending on what it triggers, the user may see image overlays, text ovelray, and otherwise unseen elements (jumpscares).
    - **Responsive Design**: I use unites like %, vh, vw to make my page as responsive as possible, in terms of viewing of different screen sizes. 

## Technologies Used

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Libraries**: GSAP for animations
    - **Other**: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design, Photoshop for editing images and gif timeframes. 
    

## Live Demo

- Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Credits
List any third-party assets used in the project (e.g., sound effects, images, fonts) and provide proper attribution.
- **Sites**: Youtube, Giphy, Freesound.org, Pintrest. 
- Here is a link to most (if not all the media I used for the project): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sc3Tt6ITZbS8EMS7i4XiNR9rS-w-Gw_CGzkeSVZABvQ/edit?usp=sharing


## Future Enhancements
- List any features you would’ve liked to add if given more time:
    - I would have liked to tidy up my javscript code a lot more, as well as have added the bird chirping sound, but it wasn't working this time around.
